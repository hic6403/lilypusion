    <h2> What is Best Buddies? </h2>
  <p> Best Buddies is an organization that works in countries worldwide to provide people who have IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities) with friendships and bring awareness to the fact that people with IDD are still people. </p>
<p> In Grapevine, Best Buddies has helped to forge relationships between average students and students with IDD. The RISE program offers a place for many of these students to work together at their pace. But, some best buddies are in regular classes.  Best Buddies has impacted their lives in a positive way and helped them make bonds that last forever.</p>
  <h2> How Do I Get Involved? </h2>
  <p> Getting involved is easy! You simply have to sign up on the website down below at the beginning of the school year. </p>
    <a href="https://www.bestbuddiesonline.org/"> Sign Up! </a>
    <p>  If you don't sign up early enough, you can just sign up next year, and can still participate in things like the annual Friendship Walk, either by walking or pledging money to a walker.</p>
